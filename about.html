              My name is Eliya and I am a West-Asian woman based in Toronto. I am an aspiring social worker hoping to specialize in helping people with eating disorders and abuse survivors. I am an abuse survivor myself who also has OCD, ADHD, survived depression, and recovering from an eating disorder.

            I always felt like there was a lack of representation for plus-size people in my community and topics pertaining to eating disorders, body neutrality, and inner child healing were rarely discussed. With that in mind, I created the platform Aroosak.  Through my experience and insight, I hope to create change in the ways we view ourselves and find the roots of what makes us who we are in this moment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Aroosak is a platform built to advocate for mental health all whilst challenging and breaking down societal standards. It is a space in which we welcome vulnerability and move towards healing our inner selves using the right tools for us. 

            We discuss friendship, romantic relationships, family relationships, but most importantly our relationship with ourselves.
