                <h2>About the Brand</h2>
                <p>Aroosak candles beautifully merge Iranian traditions with the evocative power of scent, turning each candle into a unique
                storyteller. Each fragrance is crafted to be a sensory souvenir, capturing the essence of a cherished memory. Inspired by
                SWANA (Southwest Asia and North Africa) culture, the candles feature scents that resonate with these rich traditions, while
                offering modern twists that make them truly one-of-a-kind.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                The candles aren’t just about the fragrance—they’re works of art, with each one finished off with a carefully chosen name
                and design, ensuring that they’re as memorable as the moments they evoke. Hand-poured in Toronto with a blend of coconut
                soy wax, these candles are not only eco-friendly but also pet-friendly and free from the headache-inducing chemicals often
                found in other products.
                <br />
                <br />
                Aroosak candles are more than just home fragrances; they’re a hidden gem, offering a sensory journey that celebrates
                cultural heritage and the power of scent to transform any space.</p>

                <h2>About Her</h2>
                <p>Eliya Morsh’s journey into interior design is deeply rooted in her personal experiences and cultural heritage. Growing up, the scent
                    of perfumes always transported her to cherished moments, especially those spent in her grandmother’s home. Leaving home at a young
                    age, she found herself yearning for that familiar feeling of safety and comfort. What began as a way to recreate that sense of
                    belonging eventually blossomed into a creative exploration of endless design possibilities.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                For Eliya, interior design is more than just aesthetics; it’s a way to connect with her culture and the global diaspora, bringing
                people together through the beauty of heritage. She infuses her work with the essence of the traditions and memories that shaped her,
                creating spaces that evoke a sense of home—just as a scent would.
                <br />
                <br />
                Her passion for scent is an integral part of her design philosophy, where she believes that a fragrance can turn a house into a home,
                grounding its inhabitants in warmth and comfort. When Eliya isn’t hand-pouring candles in her kitchen, crafting fragrances that hold
                emotional significance, she enjoys weightlifting, making delicious steak frites, and losing herself in a captivating book.
                <br />
        
                Eliya’s approach to interior design is a beautiful mix of personal connection, creativity, and cultural pride, making her work both
                meaningful and inspiring.
